# Authentication System Implementation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing a complete authentication system for the Angular application, including user registration, login, profile management, and integration with existing components. The system will provide secure user authentication with JWT tokens, user profile management, and role-based access control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration and Login System

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account and login so that I can access personalized features and save my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN they SHALL be able to create an account with first name, last name, username, and password
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and redirect to login
3. WHEN a user enters valid login credentials THEN they SHALL be authenticated and redirected to the dashboard or home page
4. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN they SHALL see appropriate error messages
5. IF a user is already logged in THEN they SHALL be redirected away from login/register pages

### Requirement 2: JWT Token Management and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure token-based authentication so that user sessions are properly managed and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL generate and store a JWT token
2. WHEN a user makes authenticated requests THEN the JWT token SHALL be included in request headers
3. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the user SHALL be automatically logged out
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN their JWT token SHALL be invalidated and removed from storage
5. IF a user's token is invalid or expired THEN they SHALL be redirected to the login page

### Requirement 3: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to view and edit my profile information so that I can keep my account details up to date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a logged-in user accesses their profile THEN they SHALL see their current profile information
2. WHEN a user updates their profile information THEN the changes SHALL be saved to the backend
3. WHEN a user changes their password THEN they SHALL be required to enter their current password
4. WHEN profile updates are successful THEN the user SHALL see a confirmation message
5. IF profile updates fail THEN the user SHALL see appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4: Authentication State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to remember my login state so that I don't have to log in repeatedly during my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN their authentication state SHALL be maintained across page refreshes
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN they SHALL remain logged in if "Remember Me" was selected
3. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN all components SHALL be notified of the change
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN they SHALL be automatically logged out
5. IF the user is not authenticated THEN protected routes SHALL redirect to the login page

### Requirement 5: Protected Routes and Navigation Guards

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to protect certain pages from unauthorized access so that only authenticated users can access them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access protected routes THEN they SHALL be redirected to the login page
2. WHEN an authenticated user accesses protected routes THEN they SHALL be allowed to proceed
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN they SHALL be redirected away from protected routes
4. WHEN navigation guards are triggered THEN the user's authentication status SHALL be verified
5. IF a user's authentication expires during navigation THEN they SHALL be redirected to login

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Components

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication system to work seamlessly with existing features so that I have a consistent experience across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the navbar SHALL display their name and logout option
2. WHEN a user is not logged in THEN the navbar SHALL display login and register options
3. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the navbar SHALL update accordingly
4. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN it SHALL display user-specific information
5. IF the user has appropriate permissions THEN admin features SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 7: Social Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to login with my social media accounts so that I can quickly access the application without creating a new account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks social login buttons THEN they SHALL be redirected to the appropriate OAuth provider
2. WHEN social authentication is successful THEN the user SHALL be logged in and redirected to the application
3. WHEN social authentication fails THEN the user SHALL see appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a user logs in via social media THEN their profile SHALL be populated with available information
5. IF a social account is already linked THEN the user SHALL be logged in directly

### Requirement 8: Password Reset and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN they SHALL be able to enter their email address
2. WHEN a valid email is submitted THEN a password reset email SHALL be sent
3. WHEN a user clicks the reset link THEN they SHALL be able to set a new password
4. WHEN password reset is successful THEN the user SHALL be able to login with the new password
5. IF the reset link is expired or invalid THEN the user SHALL see an appropriate error message

### Requirement 9: User Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to be managed securely so that my account remains protected while providing a good user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is inactive for a specified period THEN they SHALL receive a session timeout warning
2. WHEN a user's session expires THEN they SHALL be automatically logged out
3. WHEN a user is active THEN their session SHALL be automatically extended
4. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN session state SHALL be synchronized across tabs
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the user's session SHALL be terminated

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about authentication actions so that I understand what's happening and can resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication actions are in progress THEN loading indicators SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN success messages SHALL be shown
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN specific error messages SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be implemented
5. IF validation errors occur THEN field-specific error messages SHALL be shown
