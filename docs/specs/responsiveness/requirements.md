# Mobile Responsiveness Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive mobile responsiveness across the Angular application. The goal is to ensure optimal user experience on all device sizes, from large desktop screens to small mobile devices, with particular focus on touch interactions, readability, and navigation efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fixed Navigation and Layout Structure

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the navigation to be properly positioned and accessible so that I can navigate the site without content being hidden behind fixed elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page on a mobile device THEN the fixed navbar SHALL NOT overlap with the main content
2. WHEN the viewport width is 768px or below THEN the body padding-top SHALL be adjusted to 140px to accommodate the mobile navbar
3. WHEN the viewport width is 576px or below THEN the body padding-top SHALL be adjusted to 150px for smaller mobile screens
4. WHEN a user interacts with the navbar on mobile THEN all navigation elements SHALL be easily accessible with proper touch targets
5. IF the user is on a mobile device THEN the navbar brand and icons SHALL be appropriately sized for the screen

### Requirement 2: Responsive Typography and Content Scaling

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want text and content to be readable and properly sized so that I can consume information without zooming or struggling to read.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the viewport width is 768px or below THEN heading sizes SHALL be reduced appropriately (display-4 to 2rem, display-5 to 1.8rem)
2. WHEN the viewport width is 576px or below THEN heading sizes SHALL be further reduced (display-4 to 1.8rem, h1 to 1.5rem)
3. WHEN a user focuses on form inputs on iOS devices THEN the font size SHALL be at least 16px to prevent automatic zoom
4. WHEN content is displayed on mobile THEN line heights SHALL be optimized for readability (1.4-1.7)
5. IF text content exceeds the viewport width THEN it SHALL wrap properly without causing horizontal scroll

### Requirement 3: Touch-Friendly Interactive Elements

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want all buttons, links, and interactive elements to be easily tappable so that I can navigate and interact with the site efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive elements are displayed THEN they SHALL have a minimum touch target size of 44px x 44px
2. WHEN a user taps on buttons or links THEN they SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
3. WHEN form controls are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL be properly sized and spaced for touch interaction
4. WHEN filter tabs or navigation elements exceed screen width THEN they SHALL be horizontally scrollable with smooth touch scrolling
5. IF multiple interactive elements are close together THEN they SHALL have adequate spacing to prevent accidental taps

### Requirement 4: Responsive Layout and Grid System

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want page layouts to adapt to my screen size so that content is organized and accessible without horizontal scrolling.

4. WHEN the user interacts with search or filter elements THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
5. IF the search overlay is open THEN the user SHALL be able to close it easily with a prominent close button

### Requirement 6: Responsive Forms and Input Fields

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want forms to be easy to fill out and submit so that I can complete tasks like contact forms and login without frustration.
